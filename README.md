# House-price-prediction
This ML project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model capable of estimating house prices based on historical housing data. 
This dataset is taken from kaggle datasets [ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset/data ] used for training and evaluating predictions.
This repository contains code for building a machine learning model to predict house prices using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. 
The dataset has 13 features and 545 samples  based on certain factors like house area, bedrooms, furnished, nearness to mainroad, etc.
